### Hi, I am Carlos Mena (carlosm00) 👋

I am a young man that loves learning anything possible. Former education in system and network administration, embedded systems and programming/scripting. Highly motivated by new experiences and challenges; I am not afraid to experiment with technologies I have not worked with before.

  🔭 I’m currently working on Ingram Micro as a Cloud Infrastructure Engineer.

  👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Open Source projects.

  ⚡ Currently contributing to [Spanish Python Documentation](https://github.com/python/python-docs-es) :snake:
